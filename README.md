# Software in research survey - 2014

## Introduction

In 2012 the Software Sustainability Institute ran a survey of researchers at 15 research-intensive universities in the UK to uncover their attitudes to software. For reasons that will be explained in more detail in a forthcoming blog post, the analysis of these results was conducted in Excel. To improve the transparency and reproducibility of these results, this analysis has now been repeated in Python.

## Important points

* Licence for the code and data can be found in the the LICENCE and LICENCE_DATA files respectively.
* The code runs on Python 3.
* The data derives from the [2014 software in research survey](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14809).

## Summary of process

1. Get raw survey results from survey software ([iSurvey](https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/))
1. Anonymise data
    * Delete email addresses
    * Delete answers from the "Any final comments" question
    * Save as ```The use of software in research (Responses) 24 Oct 14 - Form Responses 1.csv```
1. Clean "Question 11: Please provide the name(s) of the main research software you use."
    * Use ```parse_text_column.py``` to correct user mistakes when entering comma-separated list
    * Replaces semi-colons, carriage returns and other separators for commas
    * Save as ```software_in_research_parasable.csv```
1. Clean responses in OpenRefine
    * Use ```Software-in-research-cleaning.openrefine.tar.gz``` for cleaning
    * Uniformises university names (e.g. replaces "University College London" with "UCL")
    * Separates comma separated answers into multiple columns
    * Uniformises names of software (e.g. replaces "MS Excel" with "Microsoft Excel")
    * Save as ```Software-in-research-cleaning.csv```
1. Analyse results
1. Compare results from original Excel-based analysis to results produced by this new Python-based analysis
 
## Files and scripts

Data directory:
* ```Software-in-research-cleaning.openrefine.tar.gz``` - OpenRefine export detailing the cleaning steps
* ```The use of software in research (Responses) 24 Oct 14 - Form Responses 1.csv``` - the raw (anonymised) data from the survey
* ```software_in_research_parasable.csv``` - data after processing to make comma separation more straightforward
* ```Software-in-research-cleaning.csv``` - data ready for analysis

Main directory:
* ```parse_text_column.py``` - used to create ```software_in_research_parasable.csv``` described above
* ```requirements.txt``` - describes libraries used by the Python scripts. See "Running the analysis" for details.
* ```chart_details_lookup.py``` - stores info about charts to make design neater
* ```survey_2014_analysis.py``` - main script for analysing survey responses
* ```comparison_new_old_results.py``` - script to compare results from original Excel-based analysis of survey results and the results generated by ```survey_2014_analysis.py```

Other directories
* ```results_from_original_2014_analysis``` - stores csvs containing results from original Excel-based analysis of survey results
* ```output``` - all charts and results stored as csvs

## Running the analysis

I recommend running the code in a virtual environment [by following this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). the main steps are:

1. If not already installed, install virtualenv:
   * ```pip install virtualenv```
1. Create a project folder:
   * ```virtualenv -p <location of Python3 install directory> <name of project>```
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   * ```source <name of project>/bin/activate ```
1. Install libraries:
   * ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```
1. Run analysis scripts as needed!
