The reason for the differences come from the fidelity and guidance ability of software packages. Thanks to the tremendous developments of software package and computer capability in recent years, commercial software becomes friendly in using and covers a variety of regions. However, due to the increased complexity and expanded coverage, software is somewhat becoming a black box operation in which physical process is largely masked. Furthermore, software developers concentrate on the state of the art of operations without detailed practices, whereas analysts pay much attentions on use skills with a difficulty to flexibly test physical behaviours. I think that, if the transparency of the process and customer involvement are increased, software could have increased impacts on research projects and scientific developments. ",,False
